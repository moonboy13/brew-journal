# brew-journal
Application for tracking brewing recipes.

Also a playground to technologies so there are no guarantees that any tech choice will be logical or beneficial.

Added a create-unit-tests branch to utilize the unit test capabilities of AngularJS and Django

The following packages are required if you want to perform unit-testing. Installation of the requirements.txt
will fail w/o these packages but it should not affect site performance. Had to perform a system restart to get
the libffi-dev to work correctly

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev libjpeg8-dev

# Iteration 0.1
Create a page for CRUD on personal recipies.
